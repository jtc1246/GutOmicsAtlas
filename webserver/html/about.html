            The major research interest in the Chen Laboratory is to apply human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cells/organoids to model human diseases and perform drug screens toward development of novel therapeutics. We have identified many small molecules controlling stem cell fate decision using high throughput/content chemical screens. By combining gene targeting, directed differentiation, human organoids, and humanized mouse models, we have established several unique models to systematically explore the role of genetic and/or environmental factors in disease progression. We establish proof-of-principle that “disease in a dish” models that can be adapted to high throughput/content screening platforms and to discover drug candidates for precision therapy.

            Dr. Dongliang Leng earned his PhD degree from University of Macau under the mentorship of Dr. Qi Zhao and Dr. Xiaohua Douglas Zhang. During his PhD period, he focused on long ncRNAs identification and gene co-expression network construction, which involved in disease initiation and progress, using innovative bioinformatics approaches. In addition, he is also dedicated to construct the disease signatures for diagnosis and prognosis. Notably, he identified a prognostic ceRNA network in sarcoma which contributes to the infiltration of immune cells and shaping of tumor microenvironment. After graduated, he joined Dr. Shuibing Chen’s lab at Weill Cornell Medicine to expand his research interest on pluripotent stem cell derived ovary-organoid modeling for anti-aging through identifying the super-TF regulating network for specific populations’ differentiation and development in ovary. He is also contributing to the bioinformatics analysis for the projects in the lab across multi single cell sequencing platforms, including 10X single cell transcriptome, multi-omics, spatial sequencing, Pacbio long-reads single cell sequencing and so on.
